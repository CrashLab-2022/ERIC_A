## Abstract

It is an ERIC_A indoor delivery robot. It is a robot made for delivery of goods indoors. Basically, ERIC_A is equipped with an autonomous driving system, so it accurately identifies its current location and arrives at its destination. Also, the robot is equipped with YOLO artificial intelligence, so when you see a person on your path, it says, "The robot passes by."

After logging in through the web page, enter your name, item, and delivery address to proceed with the order. When the order is accepted, the order is accumulated in the database of the administrator page. The administrator can select from the ordered details and start shipping.
When the robot arrives at the administrator's store, the robot notifies it, and the manager puts goods into the robot through the administrator page. When the administrator presses the delivery start, the robot starts shipping to the delivery destination, completes the delivery, and returns to the start station.
